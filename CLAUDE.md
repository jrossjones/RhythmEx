## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server (Vite)
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint
- `npm run test` — Run tests (Vitest)

## Coding Conventions
- Functional components only, no class components
- Use named exports (not default exports)
- Custom hooks for all Tone.js and timing logic — keep components focused on rendering
- Audio context must be started from a user gesture (browser policy) — never autoplay
- All timing-critical code uses `performance.now()` or Tone.js Transport, not `Date.now()`
- Exercise data is plain JSON — no logic in data files
- Components should be small and composable; split at ~100 lines
- Use `refs` (not state) for values that change on every frame (playhead position, tap timestamps)
- Tailwind for all styling; no inline styles or CSS files
- Mobile-first responsive design: start with mobile layout, add desktop breakpoints

## Testing
- Vitest for unit tests
- Test timing/scoring logic thoroughly (utils/ and hooks/)
- Components: test user interactions, not implementation details
- No need to test Tone.js internals — mock the audio layer

## Architecture Decisions
- **Navigation:** Simple state machine in `App.tsx` using `AppState` — no router library. Screen is a union type, callbacks handle transitions.
- **Path alias:** `@/` maps to `src/` (configured in both `tsconfig.app.json` and `vite.config.ts`)
- **Timing windows:** On-time ≤50ms, acceptable ≤120ms, beyond = miss (defined in `utils/scoring.ts`)
- **Star thresholds:** ≥90% → 3 stars, ≥75% → 2 stars, else → 1 star
- **Transport time format:** Tone.js `"measure:beat:sixteenth"` — parsed by `utils/rhythm.ts`
- **Exercise lifecycle:** `idle → countdown (3-2-1) → playing → done` managed by `useExercise` hook. Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth playhead animation and `performance.now()` for timing. BPM adjustable only in idle phase. Accepts optional `initialBpm` parameter for speed trainer persistence.
- **Tap matching:** `useTiming` hook matches each tap to the nearest unmatched beat via `judgeTap()`. Stray taps beyond 240ms from any beat are silently ignored (kid-friendly). `finalize()` fills unmatched beats as misses. Uses refs for tap data (performance), state only for UI feedback. Feedback auto-clears after 300ms via internal timeout. Per-pad debounce (40ms) prevents double-triggers — uses `performance.now()` and `lastTapTimePerPadRef` map, cleared on `reset()`.
- **Tap input:** `TapZone` supports Space key (`keydown` with `event.repeat` guard), `onTouchStart` (lower latency), and `onClick` (desktop fallback). Flashes green/yellow/red for 300ms per judgment.
- **Drum pads:** `DrumPad` component replaces `TapZone` when instrument is drums. Grid layout adapts to active pad count (2/3/5). Keyboard shortcuts: `f`=kick, `d`=snare, `j`=hihat, `k`=tom1, `l`=tom2. Space maps to next expected pad. Each pad color-coded (kick=red, snare=orange, hihat=cyan, tom1=purple, tom2=pink).
- **Audio engine:** `useAudio` hook creates Tone.js synths lazily on first `startAudioContext()` call (user gesture). Drums: MembraneSynth for kick/toms, NoiseSynth for snare, MetalSynth for hihat. Handpan: `PolySynth(FMSynth)` with reverb (decay 3s, wet 0.35), harmonicity 2.01, modulation index 12, 800ms note duration. Triangle Synth for metronome. All synths stored in ref, disposed on unmount. `playDrum`/`playHandpan`/`playMetronomeClick` are no-ops before audio context is ready.
- **Metronome:** Clicks during countdown (on each 3-2-1-Go tick) and during playing (RAF loop tracks beat crossings from `elapsedMsRef`). Accent on downbeats (C5) vs normal beats (G4). Toggleable via settings.
- **Tempo-aligned count-in:** Countdown ticks use `msPerBeat(bpm)` intervals (not fixed 1s), so the 3-2-1-Go aligns with the exercise tempo and metronome clicks.
- **Practice settings:** `PracticeSettings` type with `metronomeOn`, `tapSoundOn`, `strictMode`, `speedTrainerOn`. Managed as state in `PracticeScreen`, controlled via `SettingsPopover` gear icon. Settings only changeable in idle phase.
- **Strict mode:** When enabled, `useTiming.recordTap(pad)` compares the tapped pad against `exercise.beats[nearestIndex].note`. Wrong pad overrides judgment to `miss` with `expectedPad` set. Free mode (default) accepts any pad for timing-only scoring.
- **Exercise drum assignments:** Exercises use drum pad names as `beat.note` — beginner uses kick+snare, intermediate adds hihat, advanced adds tom1+tom2. `exerciseDrumPads()` utility extracts the deduplicated pad set from any exercise.
- **Score storage:** Compound key `"exerciseId::instrument"` in localStorage — scores are fully independent per instrument. Each entry tracks `bestStars`, `bestAccuracy`, `attempts`, and `totalAccuracy` (enables future average calculation). `getAllScores()` returns the full dict for summary screens.
- **Results screen:** Compares current attempt against stored personal best on render. "New Best!" badge shown only when `attempts > 1` and accuracy meets or beats `bestAccuracy` (not shown on first ever attempt). Shows "Next: {bpm} BPM" hint when speed trainer is active.
- **Vertical timeline:** `VerticalTimeline` orchestrates `VerticalDrumTimeline` or `VerticalSingleTimeline`. Guitar Hero-style drop-down: future beats appear at the top and fall toward a hit line at 70% from top. Inverted Y coordinate system with top/bottom padding so the playhead stays pinned at the hit line for the full exercise (`yPosition = topPadding + (1 - frac) * exercisePixels`). GPU-accelerated `translateY`. 80px per beat vertical density. Drum columns (64px each) match active pads. Handpan column (160px) with angular offsets based on pad position. Ding note renders as full-width horizontal bar (`line` shape).
- **Legacy horizontal timeline:** `BeatTimeline`, `DrumLaneTimeline`, `SingleRowTimeline` kept for rollback. Not used in `PracticeScreen`.
- **BeatMarker component:** Reusable shape-differentiated marker. Six shapes: `circle` (kick/low register), `diamond` (snare/mid register), `triangle` (hihat/high register), `square` (tom1), `rounded-rect` (tom2), `line` (handpan ding). Text labels inside (K/S/H/T1/T2 for drums, pitch class for handpan). 16px default size. `isHollow` prop swaps fill for colored border (judgment-based via `JUDGMENT_BORDER_COLORS`). `isNext` adds pulse, `isJudged` adds ring. CSS-only shapes (clip-path for triangle, rotate for diamond).
- **Hollow/filled marker states:** Upcoming beats are solid filled. After judgment, markers transition to hollow outlines with `border-green-400` (on-time), `border-yellow-400` (early/late), `border-red-400` (miss). Smooth `transition-colors duration-200`.
- **Listen/Demo mode:** "Listen" button in idle phase starts exercise lifecycle in demo mode. Auto-fire RAF loop plays `playDrum`/`playHandpan` at beat times during playing phase. Pads visible but disabled. "Listening..." badge shown. On completion, resets to idle — no scoring, no results screen. `isDemoModeRef` checked in `handleDone`.
- **Speed trainer:** `speedTrainerBpm` state in `App.tsx`. On completion: ≥95% accuracy → +5 BPM (cap 200), <95% → same BPM, speed trainer off → null. Manual BPM change resets. "Speed Trainer" badge on practice screen. Reset on exercise select.
- **Drum pad idle colors:** Disabled pads use muted pad-colored backgrounds (`DRUM_PAD_MUTED_COLORS` from `timelineConstants.ts`) instead of gray, for visual association with timeline lane colors.
- **Handpan scales:** `HandpanScale` type in `src/data/handpan/scales.ts` with 3 presets: D Kurd (9 notes), C Amara (8 notes), F Pygmy (9 notes). Default: `d-kurd`. `getScale(id)` lookup. Exercises reference scale via `exercise.scale` field.
- **Handpan pad layout:** `HandpanPad` component with circular arrangement — center ding (64×64px) + surrounding tone fields (52×52px). Color-coded by pitch class via `HANDPAN_PAD_COLORS`. Keyboard: 1–9 for notes, Space for next expected note. Muted idle colors via `HANDPAN_PAD_MUTED_COLORS`.
- **Handpan note colors:** `HANDPAN_NOTE_COLORS` in `timelineConstants.ts` maps 12 chromatic pitch classes to Tailwind colors (C=red, D=orange, E=amber, F=green, G=teal, A=blue, Bb=violet, etc.). `pitchClass()` helper extracts pitch class from note string (e.g. `"D3"` → `"D"`, `"Bb4"` → `"Bb"`). Used for both timeline markers and pad colors.
- **Exercise instrument filtering:** `Exercise.instrument` field (`'drums' | 'handpan'`) added to type. `exercisesByDifficulty()` accepts optional instrument filter. `ExerciseSelectScreen` filters by selected instrument. 18 total exercises (9 drums + 9 handpan).

## Upcoming Phases (see SPEC.md for full detail)
- **Future improvements:** Column-to-pyramid alignment (match drum column widths to pad centers). Approach animation (osu!-style shrinking ring). Colorblind mode toggle.
- **Phase 6 — Strumming:** New instrument type. `StrumZone` component (vertical swipe + tap buttons + arrow keys). PluckSynth chord voicings (`src/data/chords.ts`). Exercises support single-chord patterns and chord progressions (`beat.note` = `down`/`up`, `beat.chord` = chord name).
- **Phase 7 — Free Play:** Dedicated `FreePlayScreen` — instrument pads + optional metronome, no timeline/scoring. Entry from exercise select. Drum customization: pad count selector (2/3/5). Handpan customization: scale/key selector + note count selector (5/7/9 notes). Both persisted in localStorage. Future home for YouTube video playback.
- **Phase 8 — Microphone Input:** `useMicrophone` + `useOnsetDetector` + `usePitchDetector` hooks. Drums: onset detection (amplitude threshold). Handpan: autocorrelation pitch detection. Guitar: root note detection (phase 1), ML chord classification (phase 2 future). Mic runs alongside virtual pads.

## Important Notes
- Target audience is young children (5+): keep UI simple, colorful, and forgiving
- All audio must be triggered by user interaction (no autoplay)
- Performance matters: rhythm apps need <10ms input latency where possible
- Exercises are data-driven — adding new exercises should only require adding JSON
- `beat.note` convention varies by instrument: drum pad names for drums, note names (C4, D4) for handpan, strum direction (down/up) for strumming
- Three planned instrument types: `drums` (implemented), `handpan` (implemented), `strumming` (planned)
